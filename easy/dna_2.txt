-Create an DNA class
  -Should have a strand property
  -Should have a hammingDistance method that takes a strand as a property


Hamming Distance Method:
-Create a variable 'hammingDistance'
-Create a variable for the stopping index;

-Create a variable for strand1 (this.strand)
-Create a variable for strand2 (the comparison strand)
-Check if the strands are the same length. If they are, set stopping index to length of strand 1. 
 If not, set to length of shorter strand

-Loop through one of the arrays. During each iteration:
  -compare the value in the current array with the value in the other array, at the same index point
  -if the values are different, add one to the hammingDistance variable
-Return 'hammingDistance'
