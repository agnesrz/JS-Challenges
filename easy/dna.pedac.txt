-Create variable to store mutations (pointMutations) and set equal to 0;
-Create loop
  -Set starting index to 0
  -Set ending index to the length of the shorter DNA strand
    -Check if the length of the DNA strands is the same
      -If yes, sent end index to length of first strand
      -If no:
        -Determine which strand is shorter
        -Set end index to length of shorter strand
-Upon each iteration, compare the characters at index i of each DNA strand.
  -If the characters are different, add 1 to pointMutations
-Return pointMutations
