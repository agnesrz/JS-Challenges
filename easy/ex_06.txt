Rules:
-Aliquot sum: the sum of the numbers that can be evenly divided into a target number 
  (for ex, 1 + 3 + 5 is the Aliquot sum of 15)
-Three kinds of numbers:
  -Perfect: Aliquot sum is equal to the number
  -Abundant: Aliquot sum > number
  -Deficient: Aliquot sum < number; prime numbers are always deficient

Algorithm:

CLASSIFY
-Take a number as an argument (target)
-Create an array to store evenly divisible numbers (divisible); initalize with value 1;
-Iterate up to num;
  -Determine whether the number is even or odd; if it is odd, start iterating from 3; otherwise, start iterating from 2
  -Increment by 2
  -Upon each iteration:
    -check if target can be evenly divided by the number
      -if yes, push to divisible
-Add up the values in divisible
-Classify the number
