Rules:
-Randomly generate a robot name
  -Should contain 5 characters
  -First two characters should be uppercase letters
  -Last three characters should be numbers
-Do not allow the robot's name to be used twice

Questions:
-What is meant by 'if it can be avoided?' Under what circumstances is it unavoidable?

NAME ROBOT
-Use a IIFE to return a new function that has access to an empty names array. The returned function should:
  -Initialize a 'name' variable with an empty string
  -enter a while loop 
    -reassign 'name' to calling generateName()
    -If 'names' does not include 'name':
      -Add 'name' to 'names'
      -break
    -Else
      -set 'name' to empty string
  -Return name

GENERATE NAME
-Create a name variable and set equal to empty string;
-Create an array to store alphabetic characters (characters)
-Create an array to store all numbers (numbers)
-Enter a loop that iterates two times. Upon each iteration:
  -get a random letter
  -push it to the name variable
-"" iterates three times
  -"
  -"
-return 'name'
